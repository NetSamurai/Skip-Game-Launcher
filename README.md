# bnetgamelaunchers
Literally zero fluff, makes use of the new battle.net game launcher commands to launch games. Default install path only.

for compatibility path must be: C:\Program Files (x86)\Battle.net

what it does: it just extracts a 0kb file that has 1 line: 
echo why you do this windowz

then runs the command to execute the game, referenced in https://github.com/dafzor/bnetlauncher/issues/22#issuecomment-399788430 

It does not need to be run as administrator.
